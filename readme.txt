The only thing we ask in return is that you KEEP the design link in the footer and do not offer this template for download from YOUR site. 

You MAY remove the XHTML & CSS valiation links if you don't want them or if your website is no longer W3C valid.

Other than that you can change everything else in any way you see fit. 

Also, if it doesn't conflict with any copyright, patent or registered trade mark, you can keep the title and the slogan as they are now. Thank you.
