    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>CreateNlrn is an innovative education sector start-up based out of Cochin, Kerala, India. The goal is to create an adaptive and interactive learning platform for students that would be fun filled and relevant to the childâ€™s age and interest areas.</p>
    <h2>Platform and Theme Outline</h2>
 <p>The advancement of technology has made a significant impact on the evolution of teaching methodology. Recent trends indicate a methodology that combines traditional face-to-face teaching methods with e-learning and self learning systems, at various levels of education. Massive Open Online Courses and Khan Academy are proofs of adoption of such concepts across the globe, at various levels.
Via concepts related to gaming and real world scenarios, the goal of the platform being created is to help the child get a feel of what they would be able to design in future, as they learn and strengthen their fundamentals in the subject areas they are studying at school. 
CreatNlrn will be designed to accommodate diverse learning styles and provide personalised lessons to help students gauge their individual potential and interest areas. The platform would provide continuous engagement to students, parents, and schools.</p>
    <h2>Adaptive and Personalised Learning</h2>
 <p>An Adaptive Learning Platform via Experiential Learning for school grade students is being designed. The design would accommodate a mixture of virtual and physical learning environment that uses the concept of gaming and its engagement models to seamlessly teach students fundamental concepts.</p>
	<h2>Adoption in the Market Place</h2>
 <p>Penetration and adoption of personal devices and broadband is a testimony of the power that is at the reach of a student.  Students are also adept at exploiting the power of such compute devices. Lower price point and high speed broad band penetration in remote areas coupled with parents, and students wanting to experiment newer ways of learning provides the opportunity space for such a platform.</p>
	<h2>Leadership Team</h2>
 <p>The venture is being kick-started by professional who have a combined 50+ Years of experience in Research and Development Areas, Core Engineering areas, teaching and training across segments and by people who are passionate about Education and Creative Learning. Very senior people with PhDs in the learning space are advisors to this venture.</p>
